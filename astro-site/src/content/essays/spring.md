The sun feels warm. Spring is here, the days are longer, the nights are shorter. I find myself sometimes wondering where you are, how you spend your days, and who you spend them with.

While it doesn't hurt as much anymore some days I still get lost and I like to imagine that you do too. I know that there's so much more out there. I can't seem to find my place in it all and sometimes I still dream in the colors of us.

Do you remember that weekend in February? The way the light beckoned through the window, the way it held our bodies together. I'm not sure how much you knew but that changed me, I lost track of time, left myself behind, and held you until I couldn't.

I've become a morning person, I wake early in the darkness now even before the birds. I'm not sure i'll ever see you again but I wanted to thank you. The greatest gift you ever gave me were the words you never said.

If you should ever find yourself alone with the light pressed heavy against your chest, remember me.
